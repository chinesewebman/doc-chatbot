based on Robby the Robot from [Forbidden Planet](https://youtu.be/bflfQN_YsTM)

By integrating the strengths of Langchain and OpenAI, Robby employs large language models to provide users with seamless, 
context-aware natural language interactions for a better understanding of their data.ðŸ§ 
#### For better understanding, see my medium article ðŸ–– : [Build a chat-bot over your CSV data](https://medium.com/@yvann-hub/build-a-chatbot-on-your-csv-data-with-langchain-and-openai-ed121f85f0cd)
## Quick Start ðŸš€

#### Based on Robby chatbot, more features added:
- multiple files supports, you can choose which file you want to ask about
- word files (.docx) supports
- local dictionary supports, if user query like "what is X", a local dict will be used in the first place to answer directly, this can avoid the hallucination of AI
- a custom moderation supports, it will analyze the altitude and topic, helps to maintain the converstaion in the way you specified
- some details tune: token exceeds limitation bug fix, random spin text displaying during waiting the response from chatgpt, custom chunk_size and chunk separator for text-splitter, custom top_k for retriever, custom prompt with or without keywords, chunk score display and so on...

#### removed feature:
- CSV agent, because I don't need it, you can find it in the original project: https://github.com/yvann-hub/Robby-chatbot

## TO-DO :
- [x] enable print tokens utilizations for the conversation
- [ ] Add free models like vicuna and free embeddings
- [ ] Replace chain of the chatbot by a custom agent for handling more features | memory + vectorstore + custom prompt
